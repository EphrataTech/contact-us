# Project Overview
- This project is a Contact Form Web Page designed to collect user input through a simple and user-friendly interface. It consists of three main files:
- contact.html – Provides the structure of the form, including fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- style.css – Handles the visual styling and layout of the form, ensuring it looks clean and is responsive across different screen sizes.
- script.js – Adds basic interactivity and form validation, such as checking for empty fields or improper email formats before submission.
- The form allows users to input their name, email, subject, and message.  It includes client-side validations and a clean responsive design.

# How to solve the conflict that occured
- We encountered a merge conflict because changes were made to the same line of code on different branches. The conflict occurred when we tried to merge - the pull request by clicking the "Merge pull request" button.

- To resolve the conflict, we clicked on the "Resolve conflict" button, which took us to a page showing the exact lines that were in conflict. There, we reviewed both versions of the conflicting code, chose the version we preferred, and removed the other.

- After finalizing the changes, we clicked "Mark as resolved" to confirm that the conflict had been handled. Since there were no remaining conflicts with the base branch, we were then able to successfully merge the pull request.

#  Customization

- To change the design, edit `style.css`.
- To add more form fields or validation logic, modify `contact.html` and `script.js`.
