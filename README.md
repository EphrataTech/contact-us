- This project is a Contact Form Web Page designed to collect user input through a simple and user-friendly interface. It consists of three main files:
- contact.html – Provides the structure of the form, including fields for name, email, subject, and message.
- style.css – Handles the visual styling and layout of the form, ensuring it looks clean and is responsive across different screen sizes.
- script.js – Adds basic interactivity and form validation, such as checking for empty fields or improper email formats before submission.
